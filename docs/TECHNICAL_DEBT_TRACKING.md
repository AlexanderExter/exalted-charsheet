# Technical Debt & Problem Tracking

## Current Status: v0.1.0-alpha

### ðŸ”´ High Priority Issues

#### Bundle Size & Performance
- **Problem**: Large bundle size from full Radix UI imports
- **Impact**: Slow initial load times, poor mobile experience
- **Root Cause**: Importing entire component libraries when using subset
- **Action Required**: Dependency audit and tree-shaking optimization
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 AI sessions

#### Component Extraction for AI Handoff
- **Problem**: 3,507-line monolithic component difficult for AI sessions to modify
- **Impact**: Future AI sessions struggle with context and modifications
- **Root Cause**: Natural AI generation pattern, but needs strategic breaking
- **Action Required**: Strategic component extraction for AI workflow optimization
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 AI sessions

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

#### State Management Complexity
- **Problem**: Multiple useState hooks creating complex interdependencies
- **Impact**: Difficult to reason about state changes, prop drilling
- **Root Cause**: Organic growth of features without state architecture
- **Action Required**: Consider context/reducer patterns for character state
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 AI sessions

#### Dependency Management
- **Problem**: Potential outdated or unused dependencies on bleeding edge
- **Impact**: Security risks, bundle bloat, compatibility issues
- **Root Cause**: Rapid development without regular dependency maintenance
- **Action Required**: Regular audits and cleanup cycles
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 AI session (recurring)

#### Type Safety During Stabilization
- **Problem**: Loose typing with `any` types throughout codebase
- **Impact**: Runtime errors, poor IDE experience, maintenance difficulty
- **Root Cause**: Rapid prototyping approach (appropriate for phase)
- **Action Required**: Type hardening during stabilization phases
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 AI sessions (when appropriate)

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority / Acceptable Trade-offs

#### localStorage Auto-save Intervals
- **Status**: Working as designed
- **Rationale**: 10-minute intervals appropriate for localStorage performance
- **Alternative**: Import/export for critical data portability

#### Manual Testing Approach
- **Status**: Appropriate for project scale
- **Rationale**: Single developer, hobby project, rapid iteration
- **Future**: Consider automation only if team grows

#### Documentation Quantity
- **Status**: Working as designed
- **Rationale**: Serves as external memory for AI development workflow

## Discovered Problems by Category

### Architecture
- [ ] **Monolith Breakup Strategy**: Need AI-optimized component extraction plan
- [ ] **State Architecture**: Evaluate context vs. prop drilling trade-offs
- [ ] **Module Organization**: Consider domain-driven component structure

## Notes for Future AI Sessions

### Context Preservation
- Always check this document before major changes
- Update progress tracking after each session
- Add new discovered issues immediately

### Prioritization Guidelines
1. **User-impacting** issues first (performance, data loss)
2. **AI workflow** optimization second (handoff, maintainability)
3. **Code quality** improvements third (types, architecture)
4. **Nice-to-have** improvements last (optimization, refactoring)
